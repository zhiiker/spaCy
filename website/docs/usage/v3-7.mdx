## New features {id="features",hidden="true"}

spaCy v3.7 adds support for Python 3.12, introduces the new standalone library
[Weasel](https://github.com/explosion/weasel) for project workflows, and updates
the transformer-based trained pipelines to use our new
[Curated Transformers](https://github.com/explosion/curated-transformers)
library.

This release drops support for Python 3.6.

### Weasel {id="weasel"}

The [spaCy projects](/usage/projects) functionality has been moved into a new
standalone library [Weasel](https://github.com/explosion/weasel). This brings
minor changes to spaCy-specific settings in spaCy projects (see
[upgrading](#upgrading) below), but also makes it possible to use the same
workflow functionality outside of spaCy.

All `spacy project` commands should run as before, just now they're using Weasel
under the hood.

<Infobox title="Remote storage for Python 3.12" variant="warning">

Remote storage for spaCy projects is not yet supported for Python 3.12. Use
Python 3.11 or earlier for remote storage.

### Registered vectors {id="custom-vectors"}

You can specify a custom registered vectors class under `[nlp.vectors]` in order
to use static vectors in formats other than the ones supported by
[`Vectors`](/api/vectors). To implement your custom vectors, extend the abstract
class [`BaseVectors`](/api/basevectors). See an example using
[BPEmb subword embeddings](/usage/embeddings-transformers#custom-vectors).

### Additional features and improvements {id="additional-features-and-improvements"}

- Add support for Python 3.12.
- Extend to Thinc v8.2.
- Extend `transformers` extra to `spacy-transformers` v1.3.
- Add `--spans-key` option for CLI evaluation with `spacy benchmark accuracy`.
- Load the CLI module lazily for `spacy.info`.
- Add type stubs for for `spacy.training.example`.
- Warn for unsupported pattern keys in dependency matcher.
- `Language.replace_listeners`: Pass the replaced listener and the `tok2vec`
  pipe to the callback in order to support `spacy-curated-transformers`.
- Always use `tqdm` with `disable=None` in order to disable output in
  non-interactive environments.
- Language updates:
  - Add left and right pointing angle brackets as punctuation to ancient Greek.
  - Update example sentences for Turkish.
- Package setup updates:
  - Update NumPy build constraints for NumPy 1.25+. For Python 3.9+, it is no
    longer necessary to set build constraints while building binary wheels.
  - Refactor Cython profiling in order to disable profiling for Python 3.12 in
    the package setup, since Cython does not currently support profiling for
    Python 3.12.

## Trained pipelines {id="pipelines"}

### Pipeline updates {id="pipeline-updates"}

The transformer-based `trf` pipelines have been updated to use our new
[Curated Transformers](https://github.com/explosion/curated-transformers)
library using the Thinc model wrappers and pipeline component from
[spaCy Curated Transformers](https://github.com/explosion/spacy-curated-transformers).

## Notes about upgrading from v3.6 {id="upgrading"}

This release drops support for Python 3.6, drops mypy checks for Python 3.7 and
removes the `ray` extra. In addition there are several minor changes for spaCy
projects described in the following section.

### Backwards incompatibilities for spaCy Projects {id="upgrading-projects"}

`spacy project` has a few backwards incompatibilities due to the transition to
the standalone library [Weasel](https://github.com/explosion/weasel), which is
not as tightly coupled to spaCy. Weasel produces warnings when it detects older
spaCy-specific settings in your environment or project config.

- Support for the `spacy_version` configuration key has been dropped.
- Support for the `check_requirements` configuration key has been dropped due to
  the deprecation of `pkg_resources`.
- The `SPACY_CONFIG_OVERRIDES` environment variable is no longer checked. You
  can set configuration overrides using `WEASEL_CONFIG_OVERRIDES`.
- Support for `SPACY_PROJECT_USE_GIT_VERSION` environment variable has been
  dropped.
- Error codes are now Weasel-specific and do not follow spaCy error codes.

### Pipeline package version compatibility {id="version-compat"}

> #### Using legacy implementations
>
> In spaCy v3, you'll still be able to load and reference legacy implementations
> via [`spacy-legacy`](https://github.com/explosion/spacy-legacy), even if the
> components or architectures change and newer versions are available in the
> core library.

When you're loading a pipeline package trained with an earlier version of spaCy
v3, you will see a warning telling you that the pipeline may be incompatible.
This doesn't necessarily have to be true, but we recommend running your
pipelines against your test suite or evaluation data to make sure there are no
unexpected results.

If you're using one of the [trained pipelines](/models) we provide, you should
run [`spacy download`](/api/cli#download) to update to the latest version. To
see an overview of all installed packages and their compatibility, you can run
[`spacy validate`](/api/cli#validate).

If you've trained your own custom pipeline and you've confirmed that it's still
working as expected, you can update the spaCy version requirements in the
[`meta.json`](/api/data-formats#meta):

```diff
- "spacy_version": ">=3.6.0,<3.7.0",
+ "spacy_version": ">=3.6.0,<3.8.0",
```

### Updating v3.6 configs

To update a config from spaCy v3.6 with the new v3.7 settings, run
[`init fill-config`](/api/cli#init-fill-config):

```cli
$ python -m spacy init fill-config config-v3.6.cfg config-v3.7.cfg
```

In many cases ([`spacy train`](/api/cli#train),
[`spacy.load`](/api/top-level#spacy.load)), the new defaults will be filled in
automatically, but you'll need to fill in the new settings to run
[`debug config`](/api/cli#debug) and [`debug data`](/api/cli#debug-data).
